EADME:

To run this program, you will need to have the latest version of python 2.7 (nd any external libraries here).  Run `python nf_main.py` to start the program.  It will produce both source and output files in the format specified in the original project.  Graph topology is randomly generated at runtime, giving realtime updates on the status of the network.  Once a solution has been found, I invite you to use the files generated as input for your own algorithms to compare with my outputs.

USAGE:

Running nf_main.py without any parameters will use default static values.  You can use `--STATIC_NAME=value` appended to the console command to tweak performance.  The static variables and their default values are given below:
